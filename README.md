# ISLR-python
Explorations in Python of topics from ['An Introduction to Statistical Learning'](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), probably the best textbook for getting to know statistical learning methods without going all into the mathematical proofs and details.
This repository contains mostly solutions to exercises at the end of each chapter. The book uses the statistical programming language R for its examples but I tried to do the exercises in Python to get to know the corresponding Python packages.
